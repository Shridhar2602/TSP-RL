# TSP-RL

This project is an implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques.

The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science. It involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting city. In this project, solution to TSP is estimated using RL algorithms (Q-Learning, SARSA, DQN, DDQN and A2C).
